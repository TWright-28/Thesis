The actively-maintained `glob` package [no](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/545) [longer](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/540) [depends](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/487) [on](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/435) `inflight`, so your best bet is to (a) pin your `glob` version to something greater than v9, (b) to (respectfully) bug package maintainers to upgrade their `glob` dependency version string, or (c) to ignore the issue because it's probably not doing you real harm anyway. For myself, it's option (c).\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-05 14:56Z] [NONE] JasoonX:\nIn our project, we resolved this issue by introducing a pre-installation step that utilizes 'npm-force-resolutions'. \r\nThis approach was complemented by adding 'glob' to the 'resolutions' section within our 'package.json'. \r\nThis modification effectively enforces the use of a newer version of 'glob'.\r\n```\r\npackage.json\r\n\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"preinstall\": \"npx npm-force-resolutions\",\r\n  },\r\n  \"resolutions\": {\r\n    \"glob\": \"10.3.10\"\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-11 16:06Z] [NONE] thetumper:\nIssue and PR in help-me, which resolves transitive issue in pino-pretty:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mcollina/help-me/issues/17\r\nhttps://github.com/mcollina/help-me/pull/18\r\n\r\nPlease give a thumbs up there, to help get some priority on it.\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-12 04:41Z] [NONE] IdanAdar:\nSnyk at it again. 🙄\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-18 16:20Z] [NONE] adominguezepiuse:\nI've been following this issue, and I can see that it has been open for a considerable amount of time.

Which in turn effects a large number of packages. However glob version 10 no longer uses inflight. So it's just a matter of encouraging package maintainers to update there dependencies to resolve it. \n\n---\n\n[2023-12-22 17:08Z] [NONE] ramdaniAli:\nusing npm-force-resolutions doesn't fundamentally resolve the issue since running npm ls glob may still show that the old, vulnerable version of the glob package is present in your dependency tree. A more robust solution is to leverage the overrides feature in your package.json. By explicitly specifying an override for glob, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"overrides\": {\r\n    \"glob\": \"10.3.10\"\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou ensure that the specified version of glob is applied throughout your project. However, for this approach to take effect, you will need to perform a fresh installation, you should delete the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file, and then run npm install. This process forces npm to reinstall all dependencies, taking into account the override you've specified for glob. After doing this, Snyk should no longer report any warnings related to glob, confirming that the chosen version is now in use without any remnants of the old version.\n\n---\n\n[2023-12-22 18:03Z] [NONE] rreeves8:\n> using npm-force-resolutions doesn't fundamentally resolve the issue since running npm ls glob may still show that the old, vulnerable version of the glob package is present in your dependency tree.

Overriding dependency versions can create instability. Each package version is not exactly the same and changing it for every use case will most likely break stuff. \n\n---\n\n[2023-12-23 10:39Z] [NONE] ramdaniAli:\nCertainly, overriding a sub dependency versions carries inherent risks, such as the introduction of unpredictable behavior or a destabilization of system components. Despite these concerns, in my specific situation where glob functions solely as a dependent of argon2, the associated risks are somewhat contained and manageable. At present, our most prudent course of action would be to remain vigilant for updates issued by the argon2 maintainers, in the hope that they will provide a comprehensive solution to the dependency concern.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n[2024-01-04 11:55Z] [NONE] davidguilherme:\nGlob package has a breaking change from version 8.x (latest with inflight) to 9.x (first without it).

I mean, besides the `.huskyrc` file in `$HOME`, in order to avoid forcing all developers to write their own `.huskyrc` file (is it possible to place that same file in the project directory?).\n\n---\n\n[2020-07-28 13:29Z] [NONE] castarco:\nSolutions like `force-stdin-tty` provided by @dosentmatter can be problematic in some cases. I'll present a quite special corner case that is very difficult to fix relying on these workarounds:\r\n\r\nI'm working on a tool to run containerized cli tools (like NodeJS and its related binaries: node, npm, npx, yarn...). So far, the tool is working quite well... but when it comes to NodeJS + Husky + Commitizen, it fails miserably.\r\n\r\nAs many other developers, I'm using Husky to manage some Git hooks, when I use the \"native\" tools (node+npm+npx) I have no problem, since it's easy to apply the `exec < /dev/tty` trick inside the hook scripts.\r\n\r\nBUT, when I run the containerized tools (even if my \"wrapper\" is smart enough to toggle correctly the `-t` and `-i` flags of the `docker run` command), there is no simple way to make it work. The `exec < /dev/tty` trick must be performed BEFORE the `npx` tool is executed (more specifically, before the container is created; so my tool has enough information to properly auto-configure itself), but right now there is no simple/clean way to configure/parameterize the \"lower level layers\" of Husky (basically the `husky.sh` script).\r\n\r\nBeing able to have a per-project `.huskyrc` file (and not just per-user), would be really useful.\n\n---\n\n[2021-03-04 05:05Z] [OWNER] typicode:\nClosing as husky 5 doesn't have this line of code anymore.", "final_classification": "Not  a Bug"}

Sometimes, instead throwing parse errors for illegal reserved words, acorn is throwing generic \"unexpected token\" errors for properties named `async`.\r\n\r\nNaturally I wouldn’t use `async` as a property name myself, but this occurs in third-party modules (e.g. uiRouter 1.0).\r\n\r\nWhile this seems to be an acorn rather than a rollup issue, I figured I would dump my fuzzy knowledge-so-far here since the issue is likely to come up for others who are using rollup _without_ transpiling to es5.\r\n\r\nI turned up [issue 165 on acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn/issues/165) which seems related, but it’s super old & was closed seemingly as a result of being (at the time) only applicable to a fork.\r\n\r\nNew acorn ticket opened: https://github.com/ternjs/acorn/issues/489\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_\\* This acorn option also gets you around issues with functions that use `undefined` as a parameter name, a common old-school technique to ‘lock in’ undefined-as-undefined in a closure — i.e. a solution to the imaginary problem of code redefining `undefined`, pre-es5)._", "final_classification": "Not  a Bug"}

Here's my folder structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── assets\r\n│   ├── css\r\n│   │   ├── style.css\r\n│   │   └── style.css.map\r\n│   └── fonts\r\n│       └── barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to happen is that all calls inside of `assets/css/style.css` will load paths _relative_ to `assets/css`. So for example, to load the hashed Barbershop font file, I'd expect to see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(../fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, by default, I'm seeing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(assets/fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf);\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which then means the browser is looking for `assets/css/assets/fonts/...`, which is clearly wrong.\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is just to set `publicPath: '/'`, so that it's _always_ pulling from the root. However, I'm using this in a framework where users can mount the app at any point, so I want to keep paths relatively to the CSS file, and not to the web root.\r\n\r\nThe closest I've been able to get to solving it is setting to `publicPath: '../../'`, which yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(../../assets/fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and works well. But - those unnecessary `../../assets` bytes are bugging me, when I should be able to just replace those with `../`.\r\n\r\nThe `text-transform-loader` seems like the perfect solution to the above, but in Webpack 3 and with the current version of Extract Text Plugin, putting them at the front of my loaders yields a `content` block that looks like the following (instead of the expected final output):\r\n\r\n> exports = module.exports = require(\"../node_modules/css-loader/lib/css-base.js\")(true);\r\n// imports\r\n\r\n> // module\r\nexports.push([module.id, \"@font-face{font-family:Barbershop;src:url(\" + require(\"./barbershop.ttf\") + \") format(\\\"truetype\\\")}html{font-family:Barbershop}\", \"\", {\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"/Users/leebenson/dev/sandbox/reactql-fonts/styles.global.css\"],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"AAAA,WACE,uBAA0B,oDACoB,CAC/C,KAGC,sBAAwB,CACzB\",\"file\":\"styles.global.css\",\"sourcesContent\":[\"@font-face {\\n  font-family: \\\"Barbershop\\\";\\n  src: url(\\\"barbershop.ttf\\\") format('truetype');\\n}\\n\\nhtml {\\n  font-family: Barbershop;\\n}\\n\"],\"sourceRoot\":\"\"}]);\r\n\r\n> // exports\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of either:\r\n\r\na) A way to have Extract Text Plugin compare the current output path with the `url()` block, and call a file _relatively_\r\n\r\nor (probably more likely):\r\n\r\nb) Get `text-transform-plugin` working with the latest version of both Extract and Webpack 3, to modify the final output instead of the garble above.\r\n\r\nAny pointers would be appreciated.

Now I can use relative `url('assets/...` paths in CSS.\n\n---\n\n[2017-10-18 17:45Z] [NONE] leebenson:\nI'm having a similar problem to the one that originally started this thread. Here's my folder structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── assets\r\n│   ├── css\r\n│   │   ├── style.css\r\n│   │   └── style.css.map\r\n│   └── fonts\r\n│       └── barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to happen is that all calls inside of `assets/css/style.css` will load paths _relative_ to `assets/css`. So for example, to load the hashed Barbershop font file, I'd expect to see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(../fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, by default, I'm seeing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(assets/fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf);\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which then means the browser is looking for `assets/css/assets/fonts/...`, which is clearly wrong.\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is just to set `publicPath: '/'`, so that it's _always_ pulling from the root. However, I'm using this in a framework where users can mount the app at any point, so I want to keep paths relatively to the CSS file, and not to the web root.\r\n\r\nThe closest I've been able to get to solving it is setting to `publicPath: '../../'`, which yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl(../../assets/fonts/barbershop.8791f5128e84171e9aa3543f533db26b.ttf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and works well. But - those unnecessary `../../assets` bytes are bugging me, when I should be able to just replace those with `../`.\r\n\r\nThe `text-transform-loader` seems like the perfect solution to the above, but in Webpack 3 and with the current version of Extract Text Plugin, putting them at the front of my loaders yields a `content` block that looks like the following (instead of the expected final output):\r\n\r\n> exports = module.exports = require(\"../node_modules/css-loader/lib/css-base.js\")(true);\r\n// imports\r\n\r\n> // module\r\nexports.push([module.id, \"@font-face{font-family:Barbershop;src:url(\" + require(\"./barbershop.ttf\") + \") format(\\\"truetype\\\")}html{font-family:Barbershop}\", \"\", {\"version\":3,\"sources\":[\"/Users/leebenson/dev/sandbox/reactql-fonts/styles.global.css\"],\"names\":[],\"mappings\":\"AAAA,WACE,uBAA0B,oDACoB,CAC/C,KAGC,sBAAwB,CACzB\",\"file\":\"styles.global.css\",\"sourcesContent\":[\"@font-face {\\n  font-family: \\\"Barbershop\\\";\\n  src: url(\\\"barbershop.ttf\\\") format('truetype');\\n}\\n\\nhtml {\\n  font-family: Barbershop;\\n}\\n\"],\"sourceRoot\":\"\"}]);\r\n\r\n> // exports\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of either:\r\n\r\na) A way to have Extract Text Plugin compare the current output path with the `url()` block, and call a file _relatively_\r\n\r\nor (probably more likely):\r\n\r\nb) Get `text-transform-plugin` working with the latest version of both Extract and Webpack 3, to modify the final output instead of the garble above.\r\n\r\nAny pointers would be appreciated.

I separated them so that when the user logs out, I only have to clear the \"userItems\" but retain the \"items\" so I can reference it again when another user logs in.\r\n\r\nHere's how the structure looks like with data.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   items: [{\r\n      id: 2,\r\n      order: 1,\r\n      name: \"xxx\",\r\n      title: \"xxx\",\r\n      description: \"xxx\",\r\n      checked: false // This can be true or false if server wants them pre-checked when user registers\r\n   },\r\n   ...\r\n   ],\r\n   userItems: [{\r\n      id: 2,\r\n      name: \"xxx\",\r\n      checked: true\r\n   },\r\n   ...\r\n   ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a reducer called `USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {\r\n  NEWSLETTERS_GET,\r\n  USER_NEWSLETTERS_GET,\r\n  USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE,\r\n  USER_LOG_OUT,\r\n} from '../actions/types';\r\n\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  items: [],\r\n  hasItems: false,\r\n  userItems: [],\r\n  hasUserItems: false,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function(state = initialState, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case NEWSLETTERS_GET:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        items: action.payload,\r\n        hasItems: true,\r\n      };\r\n    case USER_NEWSLETTERS_GET:\r\n    case USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        userItems: action.payload,\r\n        hasUserItems: true,\r\n      };\r\n    case USER_LOG_OUT:\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        userItems: [],\r\n        hasUserItems: false,\r\n      };\r\n    default:\r\n      return state;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I dispatched the action `USER_NEWSLETTERS_UPDATE`  to update the userItems, noticed that the items was somehow updated, here's the actual screenshot of the weird bug by checking the redux dev tools:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6789191/51573507-97d1da00-1ee4-11e9-8245-dfd024fda8db.png)\r\n\r\nAnd if you see my action and payload, here it is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6789191/51573536-b637d580-1ee4-11e9-924b-eb8d330568e1.png)\r\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2019-01-23T00:03:04Z", "updated_at": "2019-01-23T00:58:20Z", "closed_at": "2019-01-23T00:37:05Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 2041, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": 2041, "time_to_first_response_seconds": 2041, "time_open_days": 0.02}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 2, "unique_commenters": 2, "maintainer_participants": 1, "has_maintainer_response": true, "participant_usernames": ["dominicarrojado", "markerikson"], "commenter_usernames": ["dominicarrojado", "markerikson"], "maintainer_usernames": ["markerikson"]}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "dominicarrojado", "id": 6789191, "author_association": "NONE"}, "closed_by": {"username": "markerikson", "id": 1128784}, "closing_pr": null, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 3, "comments": [{"id": 456620581, "created_at": "2019-01-23T00:37:05Z", "updated_at": "2019-01-23T00:37:05Z", "author": {"username": "markerikson", "id": 1128784, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, "body": "I don't think that's showing any changes to `items`, just `userItems`.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, this is a bug tracker, not a support system.

It seems like it's intended behaviour but I don't know who benefits from the warning.\r\n\r\nIt is similar to #1636, but not caused by `replaceReducers`, but by wanting to merge the state from seperate reducers, which have been combined with `combineReducers`.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen `combineReducers` receives keys it doesn't know about it produces a warning stating\r\n\r\n> Unexpected key \"additional\" found in previous state received by the reducer. Expected to find one of the known reducer keys instead: \"known\". Unexpected keys will be ignored.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**\r\n\r\n[Here is a codepen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xdNgPB) with a simplified example of what I'm doing.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would not expect to see this warning, as I believe that merging state from multiple reducers is a valid use case for Redux.  Even one of the [examples in the Redux docs](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/BeyondCombineReducers.html#sharing-data-between-slice-reducers) would have the same issue if the `crossSliceReducer` added a new key rather than overriding an existing one.\r\n\r\nI don't really understand who is benefitting from this warning.  If it was warning about a missing key (after it has previously been there and there was a slice reducer expecting it) I would understand that that is something that is unusual and probably a bug, but I don't see much harm in having additional nodes that the reducer is just going to ignore anyway.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of Redux, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Redux?**\r\n\r\nI am unsure which version of Redux introduced the warning and why, but it is still present in 3.6.0\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2017-05-28T06:08:57Z", "updated_at": "2018-05-12T19:51:17Z", "closed_at": "2017-05-28T07:59:08Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 6611, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": 6611, "time_to_first_response_seconds": 6611, "time_open_days": 0.08}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 4, "unique_commenters": 4, "maintainer_participants": 2, "has_maintainer_response": true, "participant_usernames": ["esamattis", "fangpenlin", "markerikson", "mpeyper"], "commenter_usernames": ["esamattis", "fangpenlin", "markerikson", "mpeyper"], "maintainer_usernames": ["markerikson", "mpeyper"]}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "mpeyper", "id": 23029903, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, "closed_by": {"username": "markerikson", "id": 1128784}, "closing_pr": null, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 4, "comments": [{"id": 304499200, "created_at": "2017-05-28T07:59:08Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-28T07:59:08Z", "author": {"username": "markerikson", "id": 1128784, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, "body": "The point of using `combineReducers` is that you are delegating the work of updating each slice of state to a specific slice reducer.

It's vue-loader that's not working properly or changed some convention, which makes it a breaking change. I don't know what changed in vue-loader, but I was able to fix it in a few minutes. \n\nHere is my scenerio:\n\nBefore i installed vue-loader tagged `next` in npm everything was working perfectly. I was using another vue-loader version that works with VueJS 1.x. and decided to try Vue 2.0.0-rc.8 and ran into some problems about runtime and standalone builds blah blah. I fixed that as detailed [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/wiki/Vue-2.0-RC-Starter-Resources) by  installing vue-loader@next and putting the webpack cofiguration as required so that my .vue files that have <template> code can be properly compiled by webpack.\n\nI then noticed that all images, luckily expect 1, were not loading correctly as if they were not being loaded correctly. I then looked at the code of images that were in the same file with the one that was loading correctly, it was as follows:\n\n``` html\n<template>\n<div class=\"front\">\n                    <div class=\"cover\">\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/thumb3.png\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"user\">\n                        <img class=\"img-circle\" src=\"../../images/user.png\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                        <div class=\"main\">\n                            <h4 class=\"name\">Emmanuel Mahuni</h4>\n                            <p class=\"profession\">Software Engineer</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nThe second image is the one that was working properly. The other is an example of many...\n\nIt seemed like the path `assets/images/thumb3.png` is not being detected as a relative path, but `../../images/user.png` is.\n\nSo I just went right ahead and prefixed the other notorious path with a `./` to make it another type of relative path like `require` of common js requires. eg: \n\n``` html\n<template>\n<div class=\"front\">\n                    <div class=\"cover\">\n                        <img src=\"./assets/images/thumb3.png\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"user\">\n                        <img class=\"img-circle\" src=\"../../images/user.png\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                        <div class=\"main\">\n                            <h4 class=\"name\">Emmanuel Mahuni</h4>\n                            <p class=\"profession\">Software Engineer</p>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n... and boom it worked.

Hopefully you can find a workaround.", "final_classification": "Not  a Bug"}

This is a pretty specific issue/question and I apologize if it belongs elsewhere. Please delete this if it is the case.\r\n\r\nI'm developing for WordPress, and am using multiple entry points to compile my sass and JavaScript. Because you're supposed to enqueue your scripts using `wp_enqueue_script`, I am reading the manfiest file and using the file specified using the manifest (basic stuff). However, while I'm running webpack --watch, I'm also using BrowserSync to proxy to my valet install so that I can reload changes to my php and twig files. This part works well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've configured browser-sync-webpack-plugin with `injectCss: true` which injects the CSS instead of reloading the entire page. This works well, as long as I don't have the manifest plugin included. Through further investigation, I realized that when I'm using this plugin, it emits my main.js file in addition to the css files generated.\r\n\r\nThis isn't because I'm including the scss files in my javascript, because I'm using  a scss only entry point and also using webpack-fix-style-only-entries to prevent a js file from being emitted for a css only (minus webpack bootstrapping) file. Additionally, manipulating the same files with the manifest plugin doesn't result in javascript output which lets the browsersync injectCSS option work fine.\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand how webpack plugins work, but is there a way to prevent the plugin from emitting files that weren't compiled as a part of the process or to run once (or some other configurable number of times)?\r\n\r\nPotentially important parts from my webpack config: (I've excluded those I anticipate are unnecessary, so please let me know if I've missed something)\r\n\r\n```\r\nplugins: [\r\n\tnew FixStyleOnlyEntriesPlugin({silent: true}),\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Define how we name our css files and where we put them.\r\n\t */\r\n\tnew MiniCssExtractPlugin({\r\n\t\tfilename: hashedName('css/[name]', 'css'),\r\n\t}),\r\n\tnew ManifestPlugin({fileName: 'rev-manifest.json'}),\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Browsersync functionality.\r\n\t */\r\n\tnew BrowserSyncPlugin({}, \r\n\t{\r\n\t\t//Prevents a reload from happening when css is updated.

(Assuming I am remembering how `fill` works.) As in, `fill(group(left, '='), right)`.\r\n\r\nThe desired behavior would be:\r\n\r\n- If it's impossible to fit the first atom (i.e. non-breakable component) of the RHS on the same line as LHS + `=`, break after the `=` *before* breaking the RHS.\r\n- If the RHS breaks but the above does not hold, don't break after the `=`.\r\n- If the LHS + `=` does not fit on one line, break the LHS if possible, and otherwise just allow the line length to be exceeded. Do not break immediately before the `=` under any circumstances.\r\n\r\nI think this handles most of the cases in this thread correctly, except the OP's case in #2184.\r\n\r\nPossibly there are some cases where you wouldn't want to use `fill` and instead just allow breaking after the `=`, like `x = a.b`.\n\n---\n\n[2017-07-26 17:12Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] vjeux:\n@bakkot interesting!

This is kind of like #3014, but not quite.\n\n---\n\n[2017-11-14 20:00Z] [NONE] EthanRutherford:\nPersonally for `a = b`, I think you should almost never break `a = b` unless you can also break `b`.. Though it may depend on the length of `a`.\r\n\r\nfor example, I find this to be a pretty useless change:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet string = 'something';\r\nif (someCondition) {\r\n    string = 'some really long string that goes over the line width limit and breaks up the line';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n=>\r\n```js\r\nlet string = 'something';\r\nif (someCondition) {\r\n    string =\r\n        'some really long string that goes over the line width limit and breaks up the line';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe shortness of `a` makes putting `b` on the next line look awkward and imbalanced. And as said earlier, this happens all the time in object property initialization and json files as well.\n\n---\n\n[2018-07-06 10:58Z] [NONE] RenaldasK:\nWe have the same issue, and it is breaking our pre-commit hook that auto-formats the files and then runs tslint, and the wrong formatting causes tslint to report errors.

Also, when I uncomment `import React from 'react';` the linter complains that React is unused even though it is needed.\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2015-05-27T06:57:05Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-27T20:24:35Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-27T20:24:35Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 48450, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": 17726, "time_to_first_response_seconds": 17726, "time_open_days": 0.56}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 2, "unique_commenters": 2, "maintainer_participants": 1, "has_maintainer_response": true, "participant_usernames": ["ide", "yannickcr"], "commenter_usernames": ["ide", "yannickcr"], "maintainer_usernames": ["yannickcr"]}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "ide", "id": 379606, "author_association": "NONE"}, "closed_by": {"username": "ide", "id": 379606}, "closing_pr": null, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [{"name": "question", "description": null, "color": "cc317c"}], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 2, "comments": [{"id": 105883263, "created_at": "2015-05-27T11:52:31Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-27T11:52:31Z", "author": {"username": "yannickcr", "id": 13209, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, "body": "There is 2 rules to handle these case:\n- [react-in-jsx-scope](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/react-in-jsx-scope.md): that will ensure React is available in the scope where JSX is used.\n- [jsx-uses-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-uses-react.md): that will prevent the React variable to be incorrectly marked as unused.\n\nDoes theses 2 rules solve your problem ?\n"}, {"id": 106061257, "created_at": "2015-05-27T20:24:35Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-27T20:24:35Z", "author": {"username": "ide", "id": 379606, "author_association": "NONE"}, "body": "Yes, that's perfect.

Which version of webpack are you using?\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-11-15 16:41Z] [COLLABORATOR] jscheid:\nRegarding your analysis of `this-compilation`: firstly the code path definitely can get hit (the plugin works fine in our webpack config, and the test cases all pass -- try uncommenting the code in question and they will fail.) Secondly you're assuming that `Compiler.newCompilation` is only executed once per compiler run, which is not (necessarily) the case as you can verify yourself e.g. by adding some console output to that function and then running our test suite.\n\nThat is not to say this isn't a genuine bug, it's the second report of the same issue so clearly something is going on. It's just going to be difficult to fix without being able to reproduce it. Any information you can provide about the versions you're using, the build environment, your webpack config etc would be much appreciated.

Update Laravel Mix to the latest version. (`npm update laravel-mix` or `yarn upgrade laravel-mix --latest`)\r\n2. Nuke your dependencies, and reinstall from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.\r\n3. Check your `package.json` file, and ensure that there are no old Laravel Elixir dependencies that might be interfering with Mix.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Laravel Mix Version: 1.6.1\r\n- Node Version: 8.9.1\r\n- NPM Version: 5.5.1\r\n- OS: macOS 10.13.1\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nCalling `mix.sourceMaps(true, 'source-map')` will not cause `source-map` to be set as the preferred type when building for production. Instead, `cheap-source-map` will be used. Furthermore, no source maps are emitted for javascript bundles in production builds regardless; they are only emitted for bundled css.\r\n\r\nI modified [the sourceMaps method in Api.js](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/blob/master/src/Api.js#L377-L385) as follows to force my own map type preference to be honored during both production and development builds, but javascript source maps are still not emitted.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n   sourceMaps(productionToo = true, type) {\r\n        if (Mix.inProduction() && !productionToo) {\r\n            // No production source maps!\r\n            type = false;\r\n        }  else if (Mix.inProduction() && typeof type === 'undefined') {\r\n            // Unspecified type preference, fall back to the prod default.\r\n            type = 'cheap-source-map';\r\n        } else if (typeof type === 'undefined') {\r\n            // Not in prod, and no type preference. Fall back to the dev default.\r\n            type = 'inline-source-map';\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Config.sourcemaps = type;\r\n\r\n        return this;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nI plan to continue investigating this issue myself, since I need full sourcemaps for prod builds to send to Bugsnag. But any advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n\r\nYour issue will be addressed much more quickly if you can provide us exact steps to reproduce the problem from scratch.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nConfigure `webpack.mix.js` to bundle up some javascript, and pass in a source map type to the `sourceMaps` method. The resulting build will not have source maps of the type specified. My build doesn't have javascript source maps at all, but I can't tell if that's the same issue.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmix.js('resources/assets/main.js', 'public/assets')\r\n   .sourceMaps(true, 'source-map');\r\n```\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2017-11-28T22:09:06Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-04T21:08:34Z", "closed_at": "2017-12-04T21:08:34Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 514768, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": null, "time_to_first_response_seconds": null, "time_open_days": 5.96}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 1, "unique_commenters": 0, "maintainer_participants": 0, "has_maintainer_response": false, "participant_usernames": ["dp88"], "commenter_usernames": [], "maintainer_usernames": []}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "dp88", "id": 3003563, "author_association": "NONE"}, "closed_by": {"username": "laracasts", "id": 5832706}, "closing_pr": null, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 0, "comments": [], "comments_text": "", "final_classification": "Intrinsic"}

If you can't get something to bundle for the browser, it's a problem to be solved by the bundler. That said, I understand that if you are focused on front-end dev, then that is your frame of reference and it is frustrating when this happens. \r\n\r\nThat said, the issue is source-maps. We can externalize source map support, I''m not opposed to that. But I think it would be in 1.0 of snapdragon, which is under development.

I'd love to use micromatch to match globs in a browser based library, but unfortunately cannot because of the fs / path dependency. Because i'd be using micromatch in a library, I don't get to control the bundling process, and as my library is going to be advertised for browser use it's unfair of me to expect users of my library to have to change their bundling process. So I'm keen if the source maps component of this library is externalised.\r\n\r\nI understand that if both snapdragon and micromatch are intended to target node.js first and foremost, and not promise browser support out of the box, then that's fine.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I'll keep looking for another glob matcher that is designed to work in browser. I like micromatch though.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just found nanomatch, but it also has the snapdragon dependency. I really only need to use the mm.isMatch() function, perhaps I need a picomatch? :P\r\n\r\nDouble edit: I've found that minimatch actually suits me perfectly for my particular use case.\n\n---\n\n[2018-05-02 10:59Z] [MEMBER] jonschlinkert:\n> but unfortunately cannot because of the fs / path dependency\r\n\r\nwebpack and browserify have solutions for this, we've explain this so many times it's getting old.

{"owner": "JeffreyWay", "repo": "laravel-mix", "number": 2308, "id": 548462962, "html_url": "https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix/issues/2308", "title": "Cannot change the HMR port easily for multiple projects running simultaneously", "body": "-   Laravel Mix Version: 4.1.4 (`npm list --depth=0`)\r\n-   Node Version (`node -v`): 11.15.0\r\n-   NPM Version (`npm -v`): 6.7.0\r\n-   OS: macOS Catalina (10.15.2)\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nI think that HMR is not working as it should. If you run the script `npm run hot` without providing a port argument, it will bind 8080 port. It is good for a single project. A lot of times I have 3-5 projects at once, so `laravel-mix` is not good enough for my work, yet. I'm currently using my own gulp+webpack combination, but I think it would be much better to use something popular like `laravel-mix`, so let's see what's my problem.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start multiple laravel projects at once\r\n2. The first project can be run with `php artisan serve` and `npm run hot`\r\n3. The second project can be run with `php artisan serve`, now he detects, that the port 8000 is occupied, os it bind 8001 - so far so good\r\n4. Now you want to run HMR in the second project, but `npm run hot` won't work, because it just \"die\" when the port 8080 is occupied\r\n5. Ok then, run `npm run hot -- --port=8081`, hooray - it works!\r\n6. Hold on! Webpack output is still served from port 8080! And here we go.\r\n7. Open server URLs in the browser and now you see - both have the same assets!\r\n\r\nHere is the screenshot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208491-8857f200-34a3-11ea-8989-9bb491a7ec36.png)\r\n\r\nI have created 2 same laravel projects from scratch with a simple change in the app.scss - I have changed their body's background to see the effect:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208505-b2a9af80-34a3-11ea-9db2-f3a2bbdb7db8.png)\r\n\r\nWhen I look into the browser I see both projects having the same background:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208527-f3a1c400-34a3-11ea-8255-c7c0b94d76ce.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple - both projects' webpack are served from the same host.\r\n\r\nThe solution is also theoretically simple, just add this into the `webpack.mix.js` file:\r\n```\r\nmix.options({\r\n        hmrOptions: {\r\n            host: 'localhost',\r\n            port: '8081'\r\n        },\r\n    })...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I re-run the script for `test2` project and it seems to be working well, even both projects now have different backgrounds!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3219895/72208594-a96d1280-34a4-11ea-99ac-6bef63226d02.png)\r\n\r\n### But this is not a good solution.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, because you are changing a JS file, which is also in the project's repository and used by other coworkers. We can change a port for every project we create, but it's still a solution just for a single team. If you want to work on something your own/private or even for a different team, a random HMR port can be set in both teams for different projects, and it will cause a problem. Maybe it's not a common problem, but when this will occur, there will be no fix.\r\n\r\n### What is a good solution then?\r\n\r\n**Option 1:** make it possible to change HMR port in run command, for example: `npm run hot -- --port=8081 --hmr-port=8081`, since every developer is running this command separately, so there is no change for other developers.\r\n\r\n**Option 2:** check for the occupied port, if it is occupied, then add +1 and so on, until there is a free port, which will add developers much better UX when running HMR. Artisan's serve is a good example.\r\n\r\nThank you if you will look at it and sorry for a long text, hope it is clear enough.", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2020-01-11T18:23:06Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-11T12:18:15Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-15T06:23:33Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 5486427, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": 5224736, "time_to_first_response_seconds": 5224736, "time_open_days": 63.5}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 6, "unique_commenters": 6, "maintainer_participants": 2, "has_maintainer_response": true, "participant_usernames": ["KevinBatdorf", "krehak", "mklein994", "stale[bot]", "thecrypticace", "tominal"], "commenter_usernames": ["KevinBatdorf", "krehak", "mklein994", "stale[bot]", "thecrypticace", "tominal"], "maintainer_usernames": ["krehak", "thecrypticace"]}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "krehak", "id": 3219895, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, "closed_by": {"username": "stale[bot]", "id": 26384082}, "closing_pr": null, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [{"name": "stale", "description": null, "color": "ffffff"}], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 7, "comments": [{"id": 598016622, "created_at": "2020-03-12T05:42:02Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-12T05:42:02Z", "author": {"username": "stale[bot]", "id": 26384082, "author_association": "NONE"}, "body": "This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

I'm using `react-redux` in my `react-native` app. I was having some problems with some bugs without any errors at all. After messing with the code I managed to find the cause for the problems I'm having:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';                                                                                  \r\nimport { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native';\r\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\r\n\r\nimport DivisionAction from '../../actions/division';\r\n\r\nclass DivisionIndexView extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {showNumbers: false};\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    const { dispatch } = this.props;\r\n    dispatch(DivisionAction.requestDivisions());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  _handlePress = () => {\r\n    this.setState({showNumbers: !this.state.showNumbers});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    let nums = []; \r\n    // >>> CHECKPOINT 1\r\n    if (this.state.showNumbers) nums = [1, 2, 3]; \r\n    const numbers = nums.map((n) =>\r\n        // >>> CHECKPOINT 2\r\n        <DoesnExists key={n}>{n}</DoesnExists>\r\n    );  \r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <View>\r\n        <Button title=\"Toggle numbers\" onPress={this._handlePress} />\r\n        {numbers}\r\n      </View>\r\n    );  \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\r\n  // state.division reducer has a boolean `loaded` field.\r\n  return state.division;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(DivisionIndexView);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe previous code triggers an error when you press the button. Each time the button is pressed, state.showNumbers changes between `true` and `false`; when it is true, it makes the array `nums` (CHECKPOINT 1) equal to some elements which are then used to render the non-existing element `<DoesntExits>...</DoesnExists>` (CHECKPOINT 2).\r\n\r\nThe previous error is expected, however, if I change `this.state.showNumbers` at CHECKPOINT 1 to `this.props.loaded`, I get no errors at all, the element just doesn't render.\r\n\r\n**I'm not sure** if this error is caused by `react-redux`, however, that seems to be the case.

It was a fault on my end. I think I have a Prettier plugin (or some other formatter) in my VSCode setup which auto formats on save. I was experimenting on the current project to format on save through eslint (with prettier plugin). There must have been some conflict between the two... I forgot I switched to another project and enabled the editor's format on save setting (as this project did not have the eslint setup to format on save). Going back to this project, both pieces of software were formatting on save and I got very unpredictable results.\r\n\r\nMy fault - I now put a project specific `settings.json` file in the project that formats through eslint / prettier plugin.\r\n\r\nSorry, not completely sure about my own setup...

Sooooooooooooooooooo aggravating. \n\n---\n\n[2021-08-27 06:27Z] [MEMBER] lydell:\n@mvarsakelis One of Prettier’s goals is to never introduce errors in your code.

Previously mentioned https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/issues/575 is an example. We can also imagine that a word processing application in React may rely on the structure of the DOM at runtime.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this transformation is not strictly equivalent. The semantics is slightly changed and may break things in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nPrettier is pretty widely used nowadays. It may work with various kind of toolchains, building various kind of applications, I think prettier should at least provide an option to avoid this kind of \"formatting\".\r\n\n\n---\n\n[2021-09-14 02:19Z] [NONE] gauthierm:\nThis formatting breaks React Native code where all text in JSX needs to be wrapped in `<Text>` components. In this context, it makes more sense to omit entirely than try to preserve the code that causes an error. For example:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n<Text\r\n  style={[styles.text, textStyle]}\r\n  allowFontScaling={allowFontScaling}\r\n>\r\n  {title}\r\n</Text>    <View style={styles.underline} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n<Text\r\n  style={[styles.text, textStyle]}\r\n  allowFontScaling={allowFontScaling}\r\n>\r\n  {title}\r\n</Text>{' '}\r\n<View style={styles.underline} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is valid JSX, but causes a runtime error in React Native.

The module uses regular expressions for parsing the source files for source map comments. It seems that with certain/very large source files this produces some kind of too deep/inifinite recursion.\n\nCan you upload a sample project reproducing the issue?

Since that's how we mark a variable as used in ESLint I don't see what we can do here 😐 \n\nBut:\n- We mark `JSXOpeningElement` (`<App />`) and `JSXExpressionContainer` (`{filters}`) as used but ESLint seems to correctly handle `JSXExpressionContainer` without the help of this rule. Maybe we could remove this? (All tests are still passing without it, but maybe we're missing a pattern?)\n\nThis will solve the case described by @lukeapage but we'll still have the problem with `JSXOpeningElement`:\n\n``` jsx\nlet App = <div />; // should warn \"'App' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead\" but will not\n<App />\n```\n- Apparently they are not sure if this check on `eslintUsed` is still useful (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5837#issuecomment-235490801), so maybe they will remove it?

This is a bug and a feature.\r\nWhy this a feature?\r\n- it was designed to work like this. `hot` autoaccepts the changes, and trigger refresh after zero-timeout. On component refresh it perform all the work.\r\n- in this case, just after the changes you will call `render`, and it will call `render` method of RHL, skipping the update step.\r\n - as result - everything got lost.\r\n\r\nWe expect, that you will mark as hot-exported __exports__ from some file, not imports.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy this is a bug:\r\n- we could call `update` method in AppContainer render. Easy, and will stop issues like this.\n\n---\n\n[2018-01-02 00:07Z] [NONE] mqklin:\n@theKashey thank you!

In most situations it will create a new AppContainer, without any react-tree it could reconcile with, causing or full Application remount in this case, and application __duplication__ in our styled-components example.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could do - report that the component been unmounted was not on the last generation, ie was not upgraded, but they were, as long React first render a new tree, and next destroy the old one.\r\n\r\nThe same problem in #756 - we could not rely on `generation`, as long we also should use `reload`-counter, and different branches of code, behind different `hot` decorators, could have the different values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo - there is no way to fix this issue. Yet.\r\n\n\n---\n\n[2018-01-04 14:08Z] [COLLABORATOR] gregberge:\nOK. Can we use something on `module` default export (or another export) matches with the component marked as hot?\n\n---\n\n[2018-01-04 21:25Z] [COLLABORATOR] theKashey:\nSure we could add some magic member into `HotExported`, but who and when will match the signature?\r\nThe second problem - `module.exports` in case of webpack are wrapped by getter/setter and you could not iterate through them.\n\n---\n\n[2018-01-05 08:29Z] [COLLABORATOR] gregberge:\nOK, so no fix for now.

If you reverse actions and replay them, they can fire additional, unwanted actions that are appended to the end of the event stream. This leads to a messy event stream any time you replay actions that may cause a fetch async action.\n\nThis behavior can be reproduced by adding redux-devtools to the async example. You'll see if you revert and replay the actions, that the `fetchPostsIfNeeded` action will be called again [here](https://github.com/rackt/redux/blob/master/examples/async/containers/App.js#L22).

Currently I don’t have time to implement this, but I (or somebody else) may experiment with this later on.\n\n\n---\n\n[2015-09-26 11:42Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] gaearon:\nI'll close because I don't think it's actionable here.\nDevTools redesign issue: https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/issues/74\n", "final_classification": "Not  a Bug"}

We implement the standard default behavior ourself:\n   \n   ``` js\n   function defaultHook(module, filename) {\n     var content = fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf8');\n     module._compile(stripBom(content), filename);\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   Con:\n   - You must now install for every extension explicitly (i.e. `.es6` in addition to `.js`, etc). \n   - This has implications for extensions outside your control. For example, if Babel were to only install for `.js` and expect `.es6` files to follow along - this would break that.\n   \n   Pro:\n   - I think it's more straightforward, easier to follow what's happening.\n\nI'm leaning towards `2`. My only concern is the Babel example I listed as a con for `2`, but I think that would be a bad choice on Babel's part anyways (I'm not actually picking on Babel here - I don't know how they do it - this is all hypothetical).\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-01-25 10:58Z] [NONE] novemberborn:\n:+1: on `2`.

Can you share the output of the following, where `x` is the ObjectID?\n- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(x)`\n- `String(x)`\n- `JSON.stringify(x)`\n- `Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === Object.prototype`\n- `Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === null`\n\nThanks!\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-05-19 21:00Z] [NONE] faboulaws:\nSorry, I actually meant mongoose ObjectID.\n\nFor an example ObjectID from mongoose we get:\n- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(x)  => [ \"_bsontype\",  \"id\"]`\n- `String(x) => \"54a28815636d7324f8040000\"`\n- `JSON.stringify(x) => \"54a28815636d7324f8040000\"`\n- `Object.getPrototypeOf(x) => ObjectID`\n\nThanks\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-05-21 23:07Z] [OWNER] ljharb:\nYou can currently do this by providing a custom `encoder` function, but you'd have to also handle all the web encoding that `qs` currently does.\n\nIt would be a pretty major breaking change to stringify rather than destructure object inputs, so I don't think that can happen. Doing it through a param could be possible, but then if your Person had an object-valued property on it, that might produce the wrong information.\n\nI'll keep thinking on it, but I think the proper solution is that you stringify your ObjectIDs before passing objects containing them to `qs.stringify`.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-07-16 05:44Z] [OWNER] ljharb:\nThis seems like it should be closed for now - I think the best approach is that you manually stringify your ObjectIDs.\n\n\n---\n\n[2017-03-30 22:34Z] [NONE] jsmestad:\nI would love to see support for this!", "final_classification": "Not  a Bug"}

The logic for handling default exports of function and class declarations did not properly take into account that those not only declare a local variable as well but that reassigning this local variable *will* reassign the default export. Cf. these examples:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// the default export will be 42 because it is the value of a that is exported\r\nvar a = 42;\r\nexport default a;\r\na = 43;\r\n```\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// the default export will return 43 because it is the binding of a that is exported\r\nexport default function a() {return 42;};\r\na = () => 43;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously, only the first case was handled properly while this PR also handles the second case right. This also cleans up some logic so that almost everything related to default exports with ids is now handled together in `ExportDefaultVariable`.", "author": {"username": "lukastaegert", "id": 12949268, "name": null, "email": null}, "merged_by": {"username": "lukastaegert", "id": 12949268, "name": null, "email": null}, "commits": 1, "additions": 38, "deletions": 37, "total_changes": 75, "changed_files": 8, "files_changed": 8, "review_comments": 0, "comments": 2, "unique_reviewers": 1, "reviewer_usernames": ["TrySound"], "total_reviews": 2, "approved_count": 1, "changes_requested_count": 0, "commented_count": 1, "head_ref": "deconflict-reassigned-default-export-id", "base_ref": "master", "head_sha": "ad62801b3c1d83554b84194f38aa388e5163b4c6", "merge_commit_sha": "df9ef2879e3a641874fa7cc64cfb2e9996288783"}, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [{"name": "t¹ 🐞 bug", "description": "", "color": "F44336"}], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 15, "comments": [{"id": 414930773, "created_at": "2018-08-22T06:54:39Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-22T06:54:39Z", "author": {"username": "lukastaegert", "id": 12949268, "author_association": "MEMBER"}, "body": "It would be nice to have a little more information.\r\n* Which output format does this apply to?\r\n* In which situations does this happen?\r\n* Do you have a repo or test case that exposes the problem?

(Sorry about the false alarm).\n\nSo my issue would be \"Is there a way to disable jsx-indent for this use case?\" (Renaming accordingly).\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-11 16:22Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\n@MoOx whether you surround the `<h1 />` in parens or not (as other rules/guides require), semantically it's a nested expression, and as such, it should be indented.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-11 17:46Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] MoOx:\nSorry but I don't really get what you are explaining.\n\nWhy _jsx_-indent is warning me about non jsx indentation? I would expect that jsx-indent rule only warn for indentation _inside_ jsx nodes, like [it's explained in the doc](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-indent.md).\n\nBtw, this seems consistent\n\n``` js\n{\n  condition1 &&\n  condition2\n}\n```\n\nBut this doesn't\n\n``` js\n{\n  condition1 &&\n    condition2\n}\n```\n\nI don't understand why the first JSX level need to be indented, seems like a bug to me.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-11 18:23Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\nOK so, `jsx-indent` handles indentation for everything inside JSX, which includes this JS - namely because the normal `indent` rule won't handle it.\n\nI agree with your \"condition1\" and \"condition2\" analogy - but that's not the same thing. Imagine that instead of \"condition2\", you had a multiline array:\n\n``` js\n// bad\n{\n  condition1 && [\n  1,\n  2,\n  ]\n}\n\n// good\n{\n  condition1 && [\n    1,\n    2,\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe reason this is the right analogy is because every JSX expression has implicit parens around them - the fact that they're optional to type, like semicolons, doesn't mean they aren't always semantically present (like semicolons). In other words, your original example, with parens added:\n\n``` js\n// bad\n        {\n          head.title && (\n          <h1>\n            { head.title }\n          </h1>\n          )\n        }\n\n// good\n        {\n          head.title && (\n            <h1>\n              { head.title }\n            </h1>\n          )\n        }\n```\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-11 18:53Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] MoOx:\nI totally understand that this code is not \"good\"\n\n``` js\n{\n  condition1 && [\n    1,\n    2,\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nBut I found this is opinionated to assume the same behavior for the JSX I provided, as I consider to be transformed as this\n\n``` js\n{\n  head.title &&\n  React.createElement(\"h1\", ...)\n}\n```\n\nAnd not\n\n``` js\n{\n  head.title &&\n    React.createElement(\"h1\",)\n}\n```\n\nI think if you got parenthesis, it's fine to yell for this code\n\n``` js\n        {\n          head.title && (\n          <h1>\n            { head.title }\n          </h1>\n          )\n        }\n```\n\nBut not on this one\n\n``` js\n        {\n          head.title &&\n          (<h1>\n            { head.title }\n          </h1>)\n        }\n```\n\nAnd eslint will not yell for code like this\n\n``` js\nif (\n  condition &&\n  condition2\n) {\n  // stuff\n}\n```\n\n On all the different react projects with different teams (note: I am freelance) I worked for the past 3 years, we indented this way, and not using parenthesis, so it's feel like I am stuck and cannot use this rule at all.\n\nCan we at least provide the user the choice via an option?\n\nI get your point for the \"it lints everything in jsx\", which make totally sense now you are highlighting this point, but we should provide flexibility (or maybe just not assume too much :p).\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-11 22:58Z] [MEMBER] yannickcr:\nWell. My first intent when writing the `jsx-indent` rule was to be as close as possible to the original eslint `indent` rule (actually, most of it is a simple copy-past from the original rule).\n\nIf I remember correctly the rule assume that a `JSXOpeningElement` (`<h1>`) should always start one level deeper than his parent if they are not both on the same line (even if the parent is not a `JSXOpeningElement` itself, like a `LogicalExpression` in our case).\n\nSo... I'm divided here. Both @ljharb explanation and @MoOx expected behavior makes sense to me.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 03:17Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\n@MoOx I agree that with parens, either of the two styles would be appropriate:\n\n``` jsx\n{\n  foo &&\n  (<h1>\n    bar\n  </h1>)\n}\n\n{\n  foo && (\n    <h1>\n      bar\n    </h1>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n``` jsx\n// your preferred style without parens\n{\n  foo &&\n  <h1>\n    bar\n  </h1>\n}\n```\n\nWithout parens, I think your preferred style (the latter) is uncommon and unidiomatic, but does make subjective sense - only while omitting the parens.\n\nI don't mind adding an option for this indentation, but I'd want it to only allow it when parens around the jsx element are omitted.\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 04:40Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] MoOx:\nI really thing all 3 examples above are valid by default, but an option would be fine.\n\nNote that this code is valid with eslint\n\n``` js\n/* eslint indent: [\"error\", 2] */\n\nvar foo, bar, baz;\n\nif (\n  foo &&\n  (bar)\n) baz()\n\nif (\n  foo && (\n    bar\n  )\n) baz()\n\nif (\n  foo &&\n  bar\n) baz()\n```\n\nNote: It seems eslint indent rules does not even read indentation in if() condition. This code is valid too\n\n``` js\n/* eslint indent: [\"error\", 2] */\n\nvar foo, bar, baz;\n\nif (\n    foo &&\n        (bar)\n) baz()\n```\n\nTried on the demo http://eslint.org/demo/\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 04:51Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\nConditionals are different than jsx `{ }` - so while I think eslint's rule _should_ cover it with `indent`, I don't think that's the right analogy.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 05:51Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] MoOx:\nAbout about this\n\n``` js\n/* eslint indent: [\"error\", 2] */\n\nvar foo, bar;\n\nfoo &&\n(bar());\n\nfoo && (\n  bar()\n);\n\nfoo &&\nbar();\n\nfoo &&\n  bar();\n```\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 05:55Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\nI think you've established they're not parallel :-) However I think that's a gap in `indent`, and it's an appropriate thing for `jsx-indent` to be enforcing.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-12 07:03Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] MoOx:\nLinting is also about coding style and preferences, that why I was asking to allow this syntax to not be considered as an error.

The interesting things is that using *got* in version **10.7.0** works also in Node **10.15.1**.\r\n\r\nIn this [repo](https://github.com/dapuicon/got-issue.git) I have reproduced the problem.\n\n---\n\n[2020-06-13 09:33Z] [COLLABORATOR] Giotino:\nI found something.\r\n\r\nThis issue has nothing to do with the `authorization` header, but since it's echoed in the response body it can change the behavior.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that got seems to have problem with the gzip compression. The postman echo decides to use gzip only if the size of the body exceed a certain size, with express I found that the minimum body size is 1Kb.\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce\r\n```ts\r\nimport got from \"../source\";\r\nimport express = require(\"express\");\r\nconst compression = require('compression');\r\n\r\nconst app = express();\r\napp.use(compression({ filter: (_req: any, _res: any) => true }));\r\napp.get(\"/\", (_req: any, res: any, _next: any) => {\r\n  let body = '';\r\n  for(let i=0; i<1024; i++) body += 'a';\r\n  res.end(body);\r\n});\r\n\r\n(async () => {\r\n  const server = app.listen(4444);\r\n  \r\n\ttry {\r\n\t\tawait got(\"http://127.0.0.1:4444\");\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"END\");\r\n\t} catch {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(\"ERROR\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tserver.close();\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround could be removing the compression `await got({decompress: false});`\n\n---\n\n[2020-06-13 09:52Z] [COLLABORATOR] Giotino:\nSince it's not happening on Node.JS v10.21.0 that's the latest 10 available, nor on the v10.15.3 I would conclude that's some kind of bug of Node.JS v10.15.1.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Update Node.JS\n\n---\n\n[2020-07-04 12:48Z] [COLLABORATOR] szmarczak:\nI can reproduce https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/issues/1287#issuecomment-639502097 on `11.4.0` and Node.js 14.5.0.\n\n---\n\n[2020-07-04 12:48Z] [COLLABORATOR] szmarczak:\nIndeed, it is working as expected on `10.7.0`.\n\n---\n\n[2020-07-04 13:15Z] [COLLABORATOR] szmarczak:\nSo I figured out what happens.

Please provide one by:\r\n  1. Using the REPL at https://rollupjs.org/repl/, or\r\n  2. Work to isolate the problem and provide the exact steps in this issue, or\r\n  3. Provide a minimal repository link (Read https://git.io/fNzHA for instructions).\r\n     These may take more time to triage than the other options.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThree ways  to reproduce:\r\n\r\nBug #1. Following the tutorial from https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#tutorial create these files\r\n\r\nmain.js\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport foo from './foo.js';\r\nexport default function () {\r\n  console.log(foo);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo.js\r\n`export default 'hello world!';`\r\n\r\nrollup.config.js\r\n```\r\nexport default {\r\n  input: 'src/main.js',\r\n  output: {\r\n    file: 'bundle.js',\r\n    format: 'esm'\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n~    \r\n\r\nrun command `rollup -c`\r\n\r\nBug #2.

It's disappointing to see a typographic defense of all things for restricting valid input.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 18:12Z] [NONE] duane:\nNotably, ASCII 39 (`'`) is primarily apostrophe, aka `&apos;`. This is how most fonts render the glyph; the only subculture that uses this as a right quote are japanese fonts that render it as a right single quotation mark. Furthermore, using single quotation marks in prose is vanishingly rare these days, whereas english contractions and possessives are as common as ever. You're hamstringing prose to support the typographer for no demonstrative benefit in the general case.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 20:26Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] julienw:\nYou can disable the rule if you don't like it.\r\n\r\nI'm finding it useful, especially because github highlighting engine goes crazy with an alone apostrophe.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 21:20Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\n@duane english contractions and possessives should only be curly quotes too. The benefit is that curly quotes can't enclose HTML attribute values, which means the presence of a curly quote is never a bug, but the presence of a straight quote might be one.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 21:23Z] [NONE] duane:\n@ljharb \r\n\r\n> @duane english contractions and possessives should only be curly quotes too.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect; it's an apostrophe, and it is wildly different than a quotation mark.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 21:27Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] julienw:\nThere are a lot of symbols that look alike. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe) is very clear.\r\nYou can use `’` as an apostrophe. You're right, a quotation mark `’` is not correct. Even if that looks alike in most fonts.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-21 21:40Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\n@duane technically `'` is not an apostrophe; `’` is. `'` is only used for notating \"minutes\" in degree-minute-second notation.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-22 21:23Z] [NONE] duane:\n@ljharb, @julienw, check the ascii spec. `'` is an apostrophe.\r\n\r\n@ljharb, that is a right single quotation mark, not an apostrophe; you only use it for closing quotations that were started with a left single quotation mark.\n\n---\n\n[2017-09-22 21:26Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\nI understand that's how computers describe it; however, typography, not the ASCII spec, determines what a character is, and what should be used.\n\n---\n\n[2017-11-07 19:41Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] taion:\nSee http://www.unicode.org/Public/10.0.0/ucd/NamesList.txt.

That's actually `′` (U+2032), the prime character.\r\n\r\nI\\`m not sure there are any cases where `'` (U+0027) is the preferred character, though obviously it⁗s convenient and easy to use in many cases.\r\n\r\nI think it's quite fair to discourage the use of that character via lint rules, though.\n\n---\n\n[2018-09-06 21:41Z] [NONE] jimrandomh:\nFor the benefit of other people who come across this: Put `\"react/no-unescaped-entities\": 0` in the `rules` section of `.eslintrc`.

Single quotes are perfectly valid in HTML, and are the correct way to type english.

Also, even though you say straight quotes shouldn't be used, I see in your previous comments that you're using straight quotes for apostrophes. Could this be because it's inconvenient to go lookup special unicode characters like I said?\n\n---\n\n[2025-10-02 18:44Z] [MEMBER] ljharb:\nLots of things are valid in HTML.\n\nIt's because comments are casual, not formal/professional writing like you'd expect on a webpage.\n\nAlso, wrapping the text in curly braces is pretty trivial.\n\n---\n\n[2025-10-02 19:59Z] [NONE] distinctdan:\nYes, lots of things are valid in HTML, and therefore shouldn't be prevented. The whole point of this rule is to prevent _invalid_ things, not _valid_ things. Your comment about formal/professional is nonsense, no website replaces all of their apostrophes with fancy unicode apostrophes. You're preventing people from writing perfectly valid HTML, and you don't seem to care at all about inconvenience. Also, you can't seem to be bothered to even follow your own rule, thus proving my point that it's inconvenient and irrelevant.\n\n---\n\n[2025-10-02 21:44Z] [CONTRIBUTOR] julienw:\nThe documentation has all the rationale, and gives you information about how to change the set of checked characters. You should go and read it instead of insulting folks providing tools for free on their free time.

This plugin is downloaded almost 28 million times a week, and there's less than 100 downvotes here.\n\nIf your english strings aren't going through a translation system (which this rule wouldn't be warning about), then you can configure that system to put the proper quotes in, and have straight quotes in your source. If you're not doing i18n, then I'm not sure readability is a high priority for you.\n\n---\n\n[2025-10-02 23:03Z] [NONE] distinctdan:\nThat's still a lot of downvotes. Most issues don't have any downvotes. If someone is using a translation system, then they won't run into the problem introduced by this rule in the first place, so that's not relevant here. What is relevant is that you're trying to prevent people from writing normal, correct english over obscure typographical concerns.

Thanks!\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 12:24Z] [NONE] ThomHurks:\nHmm, if that's true then that explains why switching back to ```node-sass``` didn't help.\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 12:30Z] [NONE] nsivertsen:\nWe should probably also check for node-sass here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/blob/master/src/components/Vue.js#L119-L123\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 13:56Z] [COLLABORATOR] JeffreyWay:\n@nsivertsen That code checks to see if you have Dart Sass installed. If you do, it uses that as the implementation. Otherwise it sticks with the default, which is node-sass.\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 14:26Z] [NONE] ThomHurks:\nHmm, I tried again with Laravel Mix 4.0.4 to only have ```node-sass``` installed as a dev dependency, and using\r\n```javascript\r\nmix.sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css', {\r\n    implementation: require('node-sass')\r\n});\r\n```\r\nand then running ```npm run dev``` and it does automatically install ```sass``` as a dependency. Laravel-Mix as of version 4 should only install ```sass``` if it uses it, right? So either it does use it somewhere, or maybe it installs it by mistake.\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 14:53Z] [NONE] nsivertsen:\nYeah, seeing the same behaviour.\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 15:10Z] [COLLABORATOR] JeffreyWay:\nAh yep, that's the issue. If calling `mix.sass()`, it always specifies `sass` as a required dependency, even if you've manually pulled in `node-sass`. So once the Vue component has to determine which Sass implementation to use, it sees that `sass` is installed, and assumes that's the one you want. Fixing now.\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 15:12Z] [NONE] ThomHurks:\nGreat, thanks!\n\n---\n\n[2018-12-12 15:19Z] [NONE] nsivertsen:\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n[2019-01-05 12:54Z] [NONE] dmitry-ivanov:\n@ThomHurks As I understood, the workaround is to use `node-sass` implementation, right?\r\n\r\nBut it's just a temporary solution, no?\r\n\r\n`/deep/` and `>>>` are both deprecated, and one day, they would be removed from the `node-sass` too?\r\n\r\nPS: It looks like Dart Sass added `::ng-deep` support for a [similar problem in Angular](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/154#issuecomment-309097985), so Vue have to introduce some kind of \"::vue-deep\" for that? And then Dart Sass have to support it as well?... (too many steps... :) )\r\n\r\nAre there any \"stable\" solutions now?\n\n---\n\n[2019-01-05 14:34Z] [NONE] ThomHurks:\nYes, ```/deep/``` and ```>>>``` used to be part of SCSS/SASS, so they're valid when parsed using ```node-sass``` for now. The Vue loader then gives them special meaning when you use them inside a scoped component. If ```node-sass``` removes ```/deep/``` and ```>>>``` in the future and it's no longer valid SCSS in ```node-sass``` too, then I guess Vue has to invent something else. The problem is that the style is parsed before the Vue loader processes it, so whatever they invent should be added to ```node-sass``` and ```dart-sass``` too.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been reported to Vue a while ago, but they're not taking any action. If everyone's code breaks some day they'll probably act fast though. That's how it usually works ;)\n\n---\n\n[2019-02-24 20:10Z] [NONE] NaturalDevCR:\nUsing node-saas only withouth saas on the dependencies solved this for me\n\n---\n\n[2019-09-05 19:01Z] [NONE] nobiit:\nHi everyone, here is the solution:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmix.options({\r\n    postCss: [\r\n        postcss.plugin('deepCssVueScoped', () => {\r\n            let sign = '[deep]';\r\n            return function (root, result) {\r\n                root.walkRules((rule) => {\r\n                    if (~rule.selector.indexOf(sign)) {\r\n                        rule.selector = rule.selector.replace(sign, '/deep/');\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n            };\r\n        })\r\n    ]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it as follows: \r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.auth {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    [deep] .auth-container {\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        .auth-title {\r\n            .logo {\r\n                height: 100px;\r\n                width: 100px;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n", "final_classification": "Intrinsic"}

When making a cross-domain request, if the server isn't correctly configured for CORS, axios returns an error without `error.response` populated. This is because the XHR request fails at the browser level (during the `OPTIONS` call), which is technically a network error. For network errors, axios does not provide a response because one is not provided by the browser. If one debugs the network error returned to axios from an invalid `OPTIONS` call, one will notice that there is no way to know the status.\n\n---\n\n[2018-01-08 19:04Z] [NONE] themre:\n@raygesualdo thank you for this detailed explanation! closing the issue.\n\n---\n\n[2018-06-26 10:41Z] [NONE] boxfish-ty:\nThis is because the XHR request fails at the browser level (during the OPTIONS call), which is technically a network error.

The link in the first example is resolved as \"\"http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1514-x64.msi\" on the webpage ([try it for yourself here](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)), so I would expect url-parse to give me \"www.7-zip.org\" as host name given the base url provided.\n\nIf a base url is provided, a url starting with a segment with no leading slash is considered relative to the current path (in contrast to a url starting with a slash which is relative to the web root):\n\n[From wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Examples_of_URI_references):\n\n> /relative/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource.txt\n> relative/path/to/resource.txt\n\n[From Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005079/absolute-vs-relative-urls):\n\n> images/example.png\n> This is also a relative URL although a bit different than the previous one. This URL is relative to the current path. What this means is that it will resolve to different paths depending on where you are in the site.\n\nAlso, `a`  would be an ambiguous host name as it doesn't include the top level domain. Is it worth supporting those? In all cases I can imagine, a useful host name would have the top level domain, so at least two parts separated by a dot.\n\nIn any case, if a base url is provided it should be seen as a relative url.\n\n\n---\n\n[2016-04-04 17:16Z] [NONE] jcrugzz:\n@guiweber Why wouldn't you switch the order of the arguments here so that the proper URL with the domain is recognized as the address.

I've looked at the code that is generated into the bundle, that is throwing the error, but I am not familiar enough with the internals of HMR to figure out what could be causing it...\r\nThis is the function that throws the error (after a timeout of 100ms)...\r\n```\r\nvar chargeFailbackTimer = function chargeFailbackTimer(id) {\r\n  return setTimeout(function () {\r\n    var error = 'hot update failed for module \"' + id + '\".

Then each of these components needs to be wrapped with the hot module.\n\n---\n\n[2019-08-14 06:51Z] [COLLABORATOR] theKashey:\nSo how it was \"not working\" - full page refresh or just react remount? Which code-splitting library you use?\n\n---\n\n[2019-08-14 07:14Z] [NONE] BertelBB:\n@theKashey any change to a react component, be it class or functional, resulted in a full page refresh.

What's in the logs?\n\n---\n\n[2019-08-18 18:59Z] [NONE] hannadrehman:\ni finally found what the exact issue was in my app and was able to fix it for now. \r\ni have a hook which fetches current logged in user by calling some other hook in my app root. \r\non every RHL update the effect is getting called which forces it to fetch logged in user. thus refreshing my entire tree because the app will not work if user is not logged in.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport function useLoggedInUser() {\r\n  const {\r\n    response: user,\r\n    networkMeta: userApiMeta,\r\n    call: fetchUser, // it will never return a new reference of call. its taken care of.\r\n  } = useNetwork(userApi.getUserProfile);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n  // on every change \r\n  // fetchUser is getting called again and again, \r\n    fetchUser();\r\n  }, [fetchUser]);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (\r\n      userApiMeta.status === APP.API_NETWORK_STATUS.SUCCESS &&\r\n      user.username\r\n    ) {\r\n      sentry.setUser(user.username);\r\n      if (clevertap.isCleverTapActive()) {\r\n        clevertap.setUser(user.first_name, user.username);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }, [user, userApiMeta]);\r\n  return [user, userApiMeta];\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default useLoggedInUser;\r\n\r\n```\r\ni am not sure why the effect is getting called again and again. \r\n\r\nfor now i have simply added an if to prevent it\r\n\r\n```\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (!user) {\r\n      fetchUser();\r\n    }\r\n  }, [fetchUser, user]);\r\n```\r\n\n\n---\n\n[2019-08-18 22:37Z] [COLLABORATOR] theKashey:\nAny `useEffect` with non zero dependency list would be re-executed at HMR.

When using Socket.io in latest NW.js, binary data cannot be handles properly.\n\nThe root cause is that engine.io-parser doesn't handle `ArrayBuffer` properly.

In Node.js or NW.js, `binaryType` is always `null`. I assume it's a bug as well.\n2. `ArrayBuffer` cannot be directly read using array styled syntax `data[0]`. One should construct a TypedArray form the buffer, such as `Uint8Array`, and read the data inside.\n3. I guess here it assumes `data` could only be a Node `Buffer`.

At first I'd like to say I am a big fan of Axios. Now I'm having trouble with receiving Axios request on the Node server. I have seen similar problem posted for Apache server but there wasn't solution described. In my case server is Windows server 2016 IIS.\r\n\r\nWhile requests sent to the server located on the same machine / localhost work perfectly, same request sent via Internet to the same machine but connected as remote server fails with above error. I heard somewhere that maybe it's about need for different approach in formatting URL in Axios. I tweaked server for days and every time I get same message. I cannot find out why this error involves 404 code if all routes work properly on localhost.

I'm trying to \"decode\" a signed cookie I receive in a websocket session.

But I want to decode it in order to have the session ID stored inside.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'm trying to do:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15614466/52139942-775dfa00-261f-11e9-9a86-b2fb45d6d49f.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, i'm using the same secret password with \"signedCookie\" than in the cookieParser initialization. The result of signedCookie returns everytime the same string as the signed cookie (temp3 value in my current example). And according to your documentation:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15614466/52140074-d885cd80-261f-11e9-99fc-b7e16aeeb3b6.png)\r\nit kinda says that the signature is invalid or something like that. Is it possible that I'm missing something in my approch ? In my database where the cookie is stored, I can see the decoded cookie (i.e the session ID). So I guess that something looks wrong with \"signedCookie\" function (or maybe with my approch).\r\n\r\nYou can see bellow what I have in my request parameter.\r\nAlso, bellow, you can see what I observe when I'm trying to user signedCookie function. The output of this function is the same as the input (signedSession).

I'm working on a large project that has previously used [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) for managing the Redux state. I would like to use `immer` for new code but it seems that `immer` fails when it tries to shallow-copy an array with an overridden `slice()`. The overridden `slice()` produces a new readonly array which is not what `immer` expects.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a harmless fix: use `Array.prototype.slice(base)` or `[...base]` instead of `base.slice()` in the `shallowCopy()` method. I think many would benefit from this kind of compatibility.

transformed to `0`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'post': 'test'}});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\n0: test\r\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\r\nGet: test\r\nUser-Agent: axios/0.17.1\r\nHost: localhost:8888\r\nConnection: close\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the header name matches a different HTTP method, it is removed:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'get': 'test'}});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\r\nContent-Type:

lowercase-a header named `Get` is handled correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\naxios.post('http://localhost:8888/', null, {headers: {'Get': 'test'}});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept:

0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't see anything in the docs about special meaning for these header names when passed directly. `axios.defaults.headers` has keys that correspond to HTTP methods, but it doesn't seem to make sense to interpret the headers set directly in the same way.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\n- axios version: 0.17.1\r\n- Environment: node v8.9.1\r\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason":

As CLI utility or as plugin?\r\nPlugin\r\n\r\nIf CLI, what command was used? (e.g. `webpack-bundle-analyzer -O path/to/stats.json`)\r\nnpx vue-cli-service build --modern src/main.js\r\n\r\nIf plugin, what options were provided?

Did you by any chance use `npm update` rather than `npm install` when you updated `nyc`?\r\n\r\nIf I were you, I would go with the nuclear option: `npm cache clean && npm install -g npm && npm install -g nyc`\n\n---\n\n[2017-07-15 09:23Z] [COLLABORATOR] sholladay:\nClosing as I am 99% sure there is nothing we can do about this here.

Update Laravel Mix to the latest version. (`npm update laravel-mix` or `yarn upgrade laravel-mix --latest`)\r\n2. Nuke your dependencies, and reinstall from scratch: `rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.\r\n3. Check your `package.json` file, and ensure that there are no old Laravel Elixir dependencies that might be interfering with Mix.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Laravel Mix Version: laravel-mix@2.1.11\r\n- Node Version: v8.10.0\r\n- NPM Version: 5.7.1\r\n- OS: Fedora 27\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\nI'm trying to build a custom extension for laravel-mix which has few dependencies. These dependencies are scoped packages (i.e they begin with '@' symbol) e.g. `@fortawesome/fontawesome`.\r\n\r\nMix fails to recognize these scoped packages were already installed during the first run of the custom extension. So it tries to re-install them on consecutive run and gets stuck at this stage as I have set `this.requiresReload` to `true`.\r\n\r\n> I have found the cause for this bug and will send a PR soon.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce:\r\n1. Create sample mix extension with scoped packages\r\n```\r\nlet mix = require('laravel-mix');\r\n\r\nclass FontAwesome {\r\n    dependencies () {\r\n        this.requiresReload = true;\r\n\r\n        return [ '@fortawesome/fontawesome' ];\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nmix.extend('fontAwesome', new FontAwesome());\r\n```\r\n2. Add custom extension to the mix build chain in webpack.mix.js\r\n```\r\nrequire('<custom-extension-name>');\r\n\r\nmix.js('resources/assets/js/app.js', 'public/js')\r\n    .sass('resources/assets/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')\r\n    .fontAwesome();\r\n```\r\n3. Run Mix using `npm run dev`\r\n\r\n> It logs `Additional dependencies must be installed. This will only take a moment.` and installs the necessary dependencies (in this case `@fortawesome/fontawesome`)\r\n> Then asks to re-run Mix. This is expected behaviour thus far.\r\n\r\n4. But after re-run `npm run dev`\r\n\r\n> It still cannot find the scoped package and tries to install it again which is unnecessary.\r\n> It again asks to re-run Mix as I have set `this.requiresReload = true`. This creates a loop and never gets past this stage of loading dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "state_reason": "completed", "locked": false, "created_at": "2018-04-03T16:29:24Z", "updated_at": "2018-04-06T12:41:56Z", "closed_at": "2018-04-06T12:41:56Z", "timestamp_metrics": {"time_to_close_seconds": 245552, "time_to_first_comment_seconds": null, "time_to_first_response_seconds": null, "time_open_days": 2.84}, "participant_metrics": {"total_participants": 1, "unique_commenters": 0, "maintainer_participants": 0, "has_maintainer_response": false, "participant_usernames": ["SaurabhKharivale"], "commenter_usernames": [], "maintainer_usernames": []}, "reopen_metrics": {"was_reopened": false, "reopen_count": 0, "time_to_reopen_seconds": null, "final_resolution_time_seconds": null, "reopen_timestamps": []}, "author": {"username": "SaurabhKharivale", "id": 24896605, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR"}, "closed_by": {"username": "JeffreyWay", "id": 183223}, "closing_pr": {"number": 1578, "title": "Recognizes scoped package dependencies in mix extension - resolves #1577", "html_url": "https://github.com/laravel-mix/laravel-mix/pull/1578", "merged": true, "merged_at": "2018-04-06T12:41:53Z", "created_at": "2018-04-03T17:12:16Z", "updated_at": "2018-04-06T12:41:58Z", "closed_at": "2018-04-06T12:41:53Z", "state": "closed", "body": "Previous regex pattern replaces all characters after '@' symbol.\r\nSo package names like `@fortawesome/fontawesome` would be converted to an empty string.\r\nResulting in failure to detect the installed dependencies.\r\n\r\n", "author": {"username": "SaurabhKharivale", "id": 24896605, "name": null, "email": null}, "merged_by": {"username": "JeffreyWay", "id": 183223, "name": null, "email": null}, "commits": 1, "additions": 2, "deletions": 2, "total_changes": 4, "changed_files": 1, "files_changed": 1, "review_comments": 0, "comments": 2, "unique_reviewers": 0, "reviewer_usernames": [], "total_reviews": 0, "approved_count": 0, "changes_requested_count": 0, "commented_count": 0, "head_ref": "master", "base_ref": "master", "head_sha": "dfe881484249888cd070679fc6d19a1f6d639357", "merge_commit_sha": "c06d4c601af6d452bc22bb13ff9af0dd9a543205"}, "closing_commit": null, "assignees": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "comments_count": 0, "comments": [], "comments_text": "", "final_classification": "Intrinsic"}
